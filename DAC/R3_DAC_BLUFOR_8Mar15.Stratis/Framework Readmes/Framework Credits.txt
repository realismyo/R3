This framework has been put together for the use of creating missions for Rifling Matters.
It has been built over time using scripts and ideas from RIFM members and the Arma community.

Where possible, credit for peoples work has been maintained (Note: variable names and pieces of code may have been changed to fit in with this framework.)
Below will also try and have a maintained list of people's work used in this framework.
