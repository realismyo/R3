========== Brefing Scripts ==========

The briefing scripts are designed to allow the mission maker to supply players with crucial mission information 
without having to necessarily explain each and every step, and also to be there as a quick reference. 


===== Usage =====

- R3's init.sqf includes the variable 'r_var_separateBriefings'.
- Set this to TRUE to run a different briefing script for the different sides (BLUFOR, OPFOR, INDEPENDENT and CIVILIAN).
- Set this to FALSE to run the same briefing script for ALL of the different sides.


The following are some basic syntax rules:

- Some basic HTML works placed inside the briefing text, such as <br/> for new line.

player createDiarySubject ["Subject Handle","Subject Title"];
- "Subject Handle" = The handle used to tie records under. (default diary, which will appear under the 'Notes' section in the map screen).
- "Subject Title" = The title players will see in the briefing / map screen.

player createDiaryRecord ["Subject Handle", ["Record Title","Insert Briefing Text Here"]];
- "Subject Handle" = The handle that the record will appear under.
- "Record Title" = The title players will see in the briefing / map screen.
- "Briefing Text" = Insert whatever you want players to read here. Accepts some basic HTML. 


===== Examples =====

1:
player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Execution","This line will appear under the player's briefing notes, under an 'Execution' sub-section."]];

2:
player createDiarySubject ["MissionCredits","Credits"];
player createDiaryRecord ["MissionCredits", ["Mission Scripts","
The gear scripts in this mission were made by Mr. Agnet.
<br/>
This text will appear under a Mission Scripts sub-section, which will be under a custom Credits section in the mission's briefing notes.
